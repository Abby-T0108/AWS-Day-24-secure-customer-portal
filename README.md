# AWS-Day-24-secure-customer-portal

What I delivered today

I designed and deployed a Customer Portal Security Architecture that implements enterprise-grade protections across network, application, monitoring and compliance layers in AWS.

Proof it works
1. Network Security: VPC with public/private subnet separation, least-privilege security groups, and no direct internet access to backend systems.
2. Application Security: WAF configured to block malicious traffic, HTTPS-ready with certificate integration, and load balancer health checks in place.
3. Monitoring & Alerting: CloudWatch dashboards for real-time visibility, alarms for error spikes, and WAF metrics for attack tracking.
4. Access Control: SSH access locked to admin IPs, database restricted to web servers only, and load balancer as the single secure entry point.
5. Compliance Ready: Logging and monitoring enabled, security documentation maintained, and incident response metrics tracked.

Results that matter
1. Prevents data breaches by isolating sensitive workloads in private subnets.
2. Stops common attacks at the edge with AWS WAF.
3. Guarantees uptime with load balancer failover and health checks.
4. Improves visibility through CloudWatch monitoring and alerting.
5. Meets compliance requirements with full documentation and metrics.

Why it matters
This project demonstrates how to secure a customer-facing application following AWS best practices.
The architecture ensures resilience against threats, aligns with compliance standards and provides a strong foundation for businesses scaling in the cloud.
