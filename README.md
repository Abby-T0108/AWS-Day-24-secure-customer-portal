# AWS-Day-24-secure-customer-portal

Customer Portal Security Checklist
This project shows how I built a secure customer-facing portal in AWS following best practices for network security, application security, monitoring, access control, and compliance.

Architecture Overview
Network Security
1. VPC with private and public subnet separation
2. Security groups with least privilege access
3. No direct internet access to application servers
4. NAT Gateway for outbound traffic only

Application Security
1. WAF protection against common attacks
2. HTTPS-ready (certificate can be added)
3. Load balancer health checks configured
4. Application servers deployed in private subnet

Monitoring and Alerting
1. CloudWatch dashboard for key metrics
2. Alarms for high error rates
3. WAF metrics tracking blocked requests
4. Application performance monitoring

Access Control
1. SSH access restricted to admin IP only
2. Database access limited to web servers only
3. No public access to backend systems
4. Load balancer as the single entry point

Compliance Ready
1. All traffic logged and monitored
2. Security controls documented
3. Incident response metrics available
4. Architecture designed using AWS best practices

What I built
1. A security-focused architecture that includes:
2. Network isolation with public and private subnets
3. WAF blocking malicious traffic at the edge
4. Access controls through security groups and IAM
5. High availability with load balancer failover
6. Monitoring and alerting using CloudWatch
7. Documentation of the entire security checklist
